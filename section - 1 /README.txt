A course where I'll show how to create a web application  backend and fronted

- Vue.js
- Node.js
- Mongo
- Express.js
- Nodemon

For the purpose of this tutorial, I’ll work you through creating a RESTful API. To achieve this, we will create a RESTful todo list API (i.e. endpoints that will create a user, get or read list of all users, read a particular user).

Assumptions
I presume that you already have your environment set up (i.e Node.js and MongoDB is installed).

Kindly run npm -v and mongo --version as these will show you the version of NPM and MongoDB installed on your machine.

If you don’t have it installed, go through this link on how to install it in order for us to create a server in Node and Mongodb.

If you do have Node and MongoDB installed, let's begin the tutorial with the following basic steps.
